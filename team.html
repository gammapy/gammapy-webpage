        <p class="lead">
            This page describes the Gammapy project organisation and the main roles and responsibilities in the Gammapy
            team.
        </p>
        <p>
            This structure was put in place in January 2018 based on our experience developing Gammapy since 2013,
            as well more generally with science tool software development in the <a
                href="https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/">H.E.S.S.</a>
            and <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">CTA</a> collaborations. We also took inspiration from the way
            the <a href="https://www.astropy.org/team.html">Astropy</a> and <a
                href="https://sunpy.org/project/">Sunpy</a>
            projects are organised, since they are in a similar situation as Gammapy: a distributed development team and
            a variety of people and projects using and depending on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect this structure to evolve over the coming years, adapting to
            the size and composition of the Gammapy development team, and the requirements and needs of scientists and
            projects using Gammapy. If you would like to become part of the Gammapy team, please get in <a
                href="contact.html">contact</a>.
            Help is always welcome!

        <h2 id="coordination-committee"><a href="#cc"> Coordination Committee </a></h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The Gammapy coordination committee (CC) is the board that is responsible to promote, coordinate and steer
            Gammapy developments. It also serves as main contact point for the Gammapy project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gammapy is developed and used by people and projects from several institutes and countries, with different
            needs, priorities and schedules. Members of the CC are representatives for the major stakeholders, i.e.
            groups that have contributed significantly to Gammapy development, as well as projects like H.E.S.S. and CTA
            that are using Gammapy. In addition, the Gammapy project managers and lead developers are part of the Gammapy
            CC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ensure that scientists and projects that are using Gammapy have reliable, good and long-term support
            </li>
            <li>
                Promote the use of Gammapy by new projects, especially as science tool for CTA
            </li>
            <li>
                Support and grow the Gammapy team (help find manpower and funding)
            </li>
            <li>
                Make decisions on the scope, content and development priorities for the Gammapy package. <br>
                In many cases this will be done via <a href="https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/development/pigs/">Proposal for
                improvement of Gammapy (PIG)</a> documents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support and coordinate the use of Gammapy for scientific or technical studies and papers
            </li>
            <li>
                The CC is the official contact point for the Gammapy project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Appoint the Gammapy project managers (non-technical lead) and lead developers (technical lead)
            </li>
            <li>
                CC members should join the Gammapy CC mailing list and calls for important discussions <br>
                (day-to-day management is left to the project managers and lead developers).
            </li>

        <h2 id="contributors"><a href="#contributor">Contributors</a></h2>
        <p>
            As of March 2021, there have been ~70 different contributors to Gammapy from ~10 countries and
            ~200 people are subscribed to the Gammapy Slack. An overview of all contributors can be found on
            <a href="https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/graphs/contributors">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no useful automatic way to measure how much someone contributed. The most common measure used
            is commits to the code repository. However the number of commits is not the only a useful measure.
            Some contributors spent several days to find and fix an important bug, or implement a big and complex
            feature that only results in a single commit. If someone makes a good bug report or does code review
            or mentoring or organisational work for Gammapy it does not show up in the commit statistic at all.
            Please know that any contribution to the Gammapy project is valued!
        </p>

        <p>
            The list of contributions into conferences, hands-on sessions and schools, and for recipies can be found on the following list:
