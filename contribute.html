            <p>Anyone is welcome to contribute to Gammapy!</p>

            <p> The Gammapy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and encourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the <a href="CoC.html">Gammapy Community Code of Conduct</a>. </p>

            <p> Start by using Gammapy!! The "Getting Started" section of our <a href="https://docs.gammapy.org/">documentation</a> will give you the first steps.
                Then, if you notice a missing feature or issue, please report it (see <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>),
                and if you are interested in contributing to the development, we can team you up with a mentor from the
                Gammapy team to do it.
            </p>

            <p> As developer, we can also contribute by presenting your activities into conferences, by making tutorial presenting recipies or by animating a Gammapy school or hands-on session. The list of contributions by type is given in the following list:
