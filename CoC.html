        <h1>Gammapy Community Code of Conduct</h1>
        <br><br>

        <p>
            <strong>Gammapy is committed to fostering an inclusive community.</strong>  
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from the actual code, Gammapy is also a community of users and developers. This community is central
            to accomplishing anything with the code itself. We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the project
            and expect everyone in our community to follow this code of conduct when interacting with others.
        </p>

        <p>As members of the community,</p>

        <ul>
        <li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex,
    sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity,
    and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not
    appropriate.</li>
        <li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As
            authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.</li>
        <li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a
            variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions
            relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these
            should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel
            confident that they can freely express their opinions.</li>
        <li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the
            community. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion threads
            resulting from code contributions.</li>
        <li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism
            respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both
            within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same
            respect as people within our community.</li>
        <li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see
            violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums,
            social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions. This Code of
            Conduct has been mostly re-used from the <a href="https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html">Astropy code of conduct</a>.
        </p>

        <p> In order to report any information or issue, please contact the Gammapy Coordination Committee using its
        generic email, <a href="mailto:gammapy-coordination-l@in2p3.fr">gammapy-coordination-l@in2p3.fr</a>, or any
