            <br><br>

            <p>
            <b>Effective Date:</b> October 14th, 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thank you for visiting our websites, gammapy.org and docs.gammapy.org. At Gammapy, we are committed to protecting your
            privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy explains
            how we collect, use, and protect any information obtained during your visit to our websites.
            </p>

            <p>
            We use an open-source analytics platform called Matomo to collect anonymized information about how users interact with our
            websites. The data we collect includes:
            <ul>
              <li>the pages you visit on our sites,</li>
              <li>the time spent on each page,</li>
              <li>your approximate location (based on anonymized IP addresses),</li>
              <li>the device and browser you use to access our sites.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Important:</b> all data collected is strictly anonymized, and we do not collect any personally identifiable
            information (PII).</p>

            <h1>2. How We Collect Data</h1>

            <p>
            We have configured Matomo to prioritize your privacy:
            <ul>
              <li>no Cookies: We do not use tracking cookies. This means we cannot track users across different browsing sessions or
               websites,</li>
              <li>anonymized IP Addresses: We anonymize your IP address by removing the last two bytes (e.g., 192.168.x.x). This makes
              it impossible to identify your specific location or device,</li>
              <li>no User Tracking: We do not assign unique user IDs, nor do we track individuals over time.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h1>3. Why We Collect Data</h1>

            <p>
            We only use the collected data for the following purposes:
            <ul>
              <li>to analyze overall website performance,</li>
              <li>to improve the structure, content, and functionality of our sites,</li>
              <li>to understand how visitors use our websites.</li>
            </ul>

            We do not use this data for any commercial or marketing purposes, and we do not share the data with third parties.

            </p>

            <h1>4. How We Protect Your Data</h1>

            <p>
            We take your privacy seriously and have taken the following steps to protect any data collected:
            <ul>
              <li>all data is stored securely on our server at the AstroParticule & Cosmologie laboratory located in Paris, France,
              and is not accessible to third parties,</li>
              <li>we anonymize all data to ensure that no personally identifiable information is ever collected or processed,</li>
              <li>we do not combine the data we collect with any external databases or information.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h1>5. Your Privacy Choices</h1>

            <p>
            Since we do not use cookies, there is no need to accept or manage cookie consent for analytics purposes. However, if you
            wish to opt out of being tracked by our anonymized analytics, you can configure your browser to block all tracking or
            analytics requests.
            </p>

            <h1>6. Third-Party Links</h1>

            <p>
            Our websites may contain links to external sites, such as documentation resources or partner organizations. We are not
            responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review their privacy
            policies before sharing any personal information with them.
