            <p>
            <b>Effective Date:</b> October 14th, 2024.<br>
            <b>Last update:</b> July 23th, 2025.
            </p><br>

            <p>
            Thank you for visiting our websites, <a href="gammapy.org">gammapy.org</a> and
            <a href="docs.gammapy.org">docs.gammapy.org</a>. At Gammapy, we are committed to protecting your
            privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy
            Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect any information obtained during your visit to our websites.
            </p>

            <p>
            We use an open-source analytics platform called <b>Matomo Analytics</b> to collect anonymized information about how
            users interact with our websites. The data we collect includes:
            <ul>
              <li>the pages you visit on our sites,</li>
              <li>the time spent on each page,</li>
              <li>your approximate location (based on anonymized IP addresses),</li>
              <li>the device and browser you use to access our sites.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Important:</b> all data collected is strictly anonymized, and we do not collect any personally identifiable
            information (PII).</p>

            <h2>How do we collect data?</h2>

            <p>
            We have configured Matomo Analytics to prioritize your privacy:
            <ul>
              <li>no Cookies: We do not use tracking cookies. This means we cannot track users across different browsing sessions or
               websites,</li>
              <li>anonymized IP Addresses: We anonymize your IP address by removing the last two bytes (e.g., 192.168.x.x). This makes
              it impossible to identify your specific location or device,</li>
              <li>no User Tracking: We do not assign unique user IDs, nor do we track individuals over time.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h2>Why do we collect data?</h2>

            <p>
            We only use the collected data for the following purposes:
            <ul>
              <li>to analyze overall website performance,</li>
              <li>to improve the structure, content, and functionality of our sites,</li>
              <li>to understand how visitors use our websites.</li>
            </ul>

            We do not use this data for any commercial or marketing purposes, and we do not share the data with third parties.

            </p>

            <h2>How do we protect your Data?</h2>

            <p>
            We take your privacy seriously and have taken the following steps to protect any data collected:
            <ul>
              <li>all data is stored securely on our server at the AstroParticule & Cosmologie laboratory located in Paris, France,
              and is not accessible to third parties,</li>
              <li>we anonymize all data to ensure that no personally identifiable information is ever collected or processed,</li>
              <li>we do not combine the data we collect with any external databases or information.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h2>Your privacy choices</h2>
